### Project Description/Outline
In our project, we have created a recommendation system based on specific attributes within our dataset to predict a rating. Our application would assist business developers in finding the best location for their desired business by entering in a latitude, longitude, and selecting one or more types to see how well their business would do in comparison to the ratings of other similar locations.
