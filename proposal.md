# Project 3 - Machine Learning and D3

Predict possible additional interests based on user interests - Recommendation System

Revision
* Recommendation System based on the name/text + lat +long + types to predict a user rating 
* User will enter certain features and the machine will predict the rating
* Use weighted average or 2 different models, combine types into a list to categorize (put into a set and then combine into binary variables)

* Database
    * Ratings
    * Total user ratings (amount of users rating the location)
    * Zone of Austin
    * Location name
    * Categories

* Visualizations
    * Correlations of interests (on a map)
        * Size/color of point based on % match of prediction
    * Popular locations around Austin based on rating
    * Dropdown visualization

* Route 1: Homepage
    * Map of Austin
    * Description of Project
    * Preview of database
* Route 2: User Input & Recommendations
    * User to select name, lat, long, and type
    * Return predicition of rating a new establishment might receive
    * Map showing the recommenations
    * Other visualizations on this route or create separate visualization route
        * D3

Project Schedule
* Regularly meeting with Ed to focus on ML and office hours
* Week 1: clean/populate database, fix user input functionality and create an ERD of project functionality/structure of app
* Week 2: focus on the machine learning aspect of project
* Week 3: continue machine learning functionality and focus on visualizations, work on CSS of app and populate READMEÃŸ
